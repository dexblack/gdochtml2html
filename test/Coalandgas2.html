				<ol class="c4 lst-kix_sf92m2rqhri-0 start" start="1">
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">Mining and burning coal and fossil gas is fuelling the climate crisis. The climate crisis threatens Australia and Australian society. It is imperative to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. </span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">NSW must rapidly end all coal and gas mining and energy generation from fossil fuels. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">NSW as a major coal exporter has a significant and particular global climate responsibility to assist in global greenhouse gas emissions reduction and must end coal exports. A coal export profit driven motive is unconscionable in the face of increased global warming. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">NSW must be powered by 100% renewable electricity by 2030. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">NSW must reach 75% emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2035. </span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">Ending coal and gas mining and non-renewable electricity generation as a matter of urgent priority presents NSW with opportunities to transition to a jobs-rich, clean energy state economy. </span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">The just transition of coal workers and coal dependent communities must commence immediately. The social, environmental and economic transition requirements and obligations of fossil fuel companies must be commensurate to the need, and provided in their closure plans as a matter of priority. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">All taxpayer-funded spending to fossil fuel companies must end as a matter of priority. Including any funding to enable or accelerate exploration, construction of gas pipelines, power stations, coal mines and fossil-fuel derived hydrogen. No funding should be provided to or by government-owned bodies to build fossil fuel infrastructure. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">The rehabilitation of all mine land is a priority and should be undertaken with the primary goals of carbon drawdown and biodiversity conservation. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">During the transition to a low-carbon emissions economy, the nation&#39;s energy and metallurgical needs must be satisfied by existing coal mines and gas fields. No additional fossil gas, (particularly coal seam gas, tight sands gas and other unconventional forms of gas) is required to transition to or complement electricity from renewable sources. &nbsp;</span>
					</li>
					<li class="c6 li-bullet-0">
						<span class="c1">Additional profits taxes should be introduced and used to cover the costs of the transition to clean energy. </span>
